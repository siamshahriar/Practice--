# JavaScript Array Methods Practice

This project contains real-life, production-level examples of the most commonly used JavaScript array methods, especially in frontend development and Angular projects.

## Practiced Methods

- `forEach`  
  Iterates over array elements and executes a function for each element.
- `map`  
  Creates a new array by transforming each element of the original array.
- `filter`  
  Creates a new array with elements that pass a test function.
- `find`  
  Returns the first element that satisfies a test function.

Each method section in `js-array-methods-practice.js` contains 10 practical, real-world examples with comments and expected outputs.
